# Apply genchecks.py patch to a presumably new version of riscv-formal.
# Patch was created in the first place using:
#   diff -u riscv-formal/checks/genchecks.py genchecks.py > genchecks.py.patch
# With first 2 lines modified to:
#   --- genchecks.py	2020-05-25 15:48:34.460592981 -0400
#   +++ genchecks_bogus.py	2020-05-25 15:51:29.219859505 -0400
# because I can't comprehend how patch commands are supposed to work.

cp riscv-formal/checks/genchecks.py genchecks.py
